# ercot_texas_energy
A repo for analyzing the Texas energy grid in light of failure during 2021 winter weather event

Goal is to utilize and practice the data science tools I have learned thus far with real data from ERCOT's website.

Issue that I am currently working through is uploading the .csv files that I have downloaded to this repo for initial analysis.
